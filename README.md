# Sedoxil-diary
A Treatment diary of taking Sedoxil drug that is filling in by patient.The Diary collects the information in CSV file and at the end of a course generates a roport as another csv file.
In some cases the doctor asks a patient to make a decision about the time of taking a pill for the secong time during the day and keep tracking in a diary of self-feelings
and decisions about time taking. So the programm helps the patient to make short notes sugessting a questionnaire and keeps track of the day of treatment and how much it is left. The user can check his records for previous days at the diary.csv file or by ordering a report whenever he wants observing how many dates are unfilled if thereare any. The dates cannot be filled in retroactively
