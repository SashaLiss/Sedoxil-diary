A Treatment diary of taking Sedoxil drug that is filling in by a patient.The Diary collects the information in CSV file and at the end of a course of treatment generates a roport as another csv file. This two csv files came with the project in one folder. The diary csv file has already fields as the daynote dictionary.
Purpose in life: in some cases the doctor asks a patient to make a decision  about the time of taking a pill for the secong time during the day himself and keep tracking in a diary of self-feelings and decision making. So the programm helps the patient to make short notes sugessting a questionnaire and keeps track of the day of treatment and how much it is left. The user can check his records for previous days at the diary.csv file or by ordering a report whenever he wants observing how many dates are unfilled if there are any. The dates cannot be filled in retroactively.
